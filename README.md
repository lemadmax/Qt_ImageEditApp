Author: Zhengrui Xia
To see how the application works, download the project and run the imagepimp1.exe under the demo directory.

Development environment: Qt_4.12 + Matlab2019b + opencv_4.3.

Currently implemented algorithms for image clustering:
1). K-means
2). Genetic Algorithm
3). Bees Algorithm
4). Paticale Swarm Optimization
5). Pollen-Based Bee Algorithm
6). Ant Colony Optimization
7). Simulated Annealing
